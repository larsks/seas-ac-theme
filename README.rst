a set of rules and theme and generates XSLT transformations that will
insert content of your choice into the theme.

In order to use the files in this repository, you will need:

- A recent version of Diazo_.

If you're using an RPM based Linux distribution, you can grab the
mod_transform_html package  from the `SEAS package repository`_.
